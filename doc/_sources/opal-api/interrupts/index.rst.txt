Interrupts
==========

OPAL does not directly handle *any* interrupts. The running Operating System
is in complete control. OPAL will provide the OS with a list of interrupts that
need to be serviced by firmware, but it is up to the OS to make the appropriate
OPAL call to handle them in a timely fashion.

The host OS must pass all interrupts in the `opal-interrupts` property of
:ref:`device-tree/ibm,opal` in the device tree to OPAL. It does this using the
:ref:`opal-handle-interrupt` OPAL call.

For details on the interrupt controller, see :ref:`xive`.
